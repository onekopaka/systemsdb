  	it's my tradition to put lyrics to Pink Floyd songs into my 404 pages.
  	
  	So, so you think you can tell Heaven from Hell, blue skies from pain.
	Can you tell a green field from a cold steel rail? A smile from a veil?
	Do you think you can tell?

	And did they get you to trade your heroes for ghosts? Hot ashes for trees?
	Hot air for a cool breeze? Cold comfort for change?
	And did you exchange a walk on part in the war for a lead role in a cage?

	How I wish, how I wish you were here.
	We're just two lost souls swimming in a fish bowl, year after year,
	Running over the same old ground. What have we found? The same old fears.
	Wish you were here. 

  -->
